# data_structures
This Python program uses two basic data structures, a list and a dictionary, to implement a Library Management System. 

The `Library` class uses a list `books` to store the available books, and a dictionary `book_status` to keep track of which books have been borrowed and by whom. The `None` value in the dictionary indicates that the book is available, and the name of the borrower indicates that the book is borrowed.

The `Customer` class uses the `input()` function to get user input for the name of the book to borrow or return, and the borrower's name.

Overall, this program implements a simple library management system using basic data structures in Python.
